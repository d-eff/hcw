                <p>Health Coaches are knowledgeable advisors who provide ongoing support and
                guidance as you set goals and make sustainable changes that improve your
                health and happiness. As your Health Coach, I will listen carefully and help you
                navigate the world of contradictory nutrition advice to explore what best
                supports you.</p>
                <p>Coaching is a client-based experience, where the coach facilitates the process
                of the client articulating and moving toward his or her desired goals. A Health
                Coach simplifies the process for a client to connect the dots between who they
                are and who they want to be, enabling success in the client’s desired changes.
