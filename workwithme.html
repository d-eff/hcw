                your doctor ever recommended a lifestyle change that you found to be
                unsustainable? Have you ever wanted something in your life, but found
                you couldn’t achieve it alone?

                I received my training as a Health Coach from the Institute for Integrative
                Nutrition’s Health Coach Training Program.

                </p>
                <p>During my training, I was exposed to the most cutting-edge dietary theories,
                studied practical lifestyle management techniques, and learned innovative
                coaching methods with some of the world’s top health and wellness experts.

                <h2 class="page_title">My Approach</h2>
                <div class="quote_block">
                  I practice a holistic approach to health and wellness, which means that I look at how all areas of your life are connected.
                </div>
                <p>
                Does stress at your job or in your
                relationship cause you to overeat?
                Does lack of sleep or low energy
                prevent you from exercising? As
                we work together, we will look at
                how all parts of your life affect
                your health as a whole.<br><br>                My approach is not to dwell on calories, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It is
                not to create lists of restrictions or good and bad foods, nor will I tell you what
                meal to eat when. Instead, I work with my clients to get in touch with their
                body’s needs, because I understand that life happens and your needs will
                change. I want to equip you with the self-awareness to make the best
                decisions for yourself in any given circumstance.

                </p>
                <div class="quote_block">I believe each person is fully capable of making well-informed decisions as their own expert, not the latest magazine article or fad diet book.</div>
                <p>
                Let’s define what you value most from your well-being. We’ll use these visions
                to motivate specific goals that bring you closer to where you want to be. As
                your coach, I will not dictate a diet for you, but together we will explore why
                some foods make you feel better than others and how to strategically use that
                feedback.<br>
                <br>                Together we’ll co-create your health goals within reasonable timeframes and
                actionable objectives so you know exactly what you’re working toward. We’ll
                use a similar process around lifestyle habits to support increased mental
                clarity, improved sleep quality, and maximized energy. As we work together,
                you’ll develop a deeper understanding of the choices that work best for you
                and implement lasting changes to improve your energy, balance, and health.
                <br>
                <br>Here are some concepts that we'll explore during our work together:                </p>
                <ul class="concept_list">
                  <li>
                  <img src="http://dummyimage.com/250">
                  
                  <div>
                    <h4>Bio-individuality</h4><p>
                    The concept of bio-individuality is that each person has
                    unique food and lifestyle needs. One person’s food is another
                    person’s poison, and that’s why fad diets tend to fail in the
                    long run. Working on the principle of bio-individuality, I’ll
                    support you to make positive changes that are based on your
                    unique needs, lifestyle, preferences, and ancestral
                    background. I use a personalized, holistic approach to ensure
                    that you will have great success!

                    </p>
                  </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <img src="http://dummyimage.com/250">
                  
                  <div>
                    <h4>Primary Food</h4><p>
         It’s easy to overlook all of the things that contribute to our
         sense of nourishment and fulfillment. It’s not just the food we
         eat that affects our health, but all of the other factors present
         in our daily lives. Healthy relationships, a fulfilling career,
         regular physical activity, and a spiritual awareness are
         essential forms of nourishment. When these “primary foods”
         are balanced, what you eat becomes secondary. I will support
         you in achieving all of your goals, from eating the right foods
         for your body to living an inspired, fulfilling life.

                    </p>
                  </div>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                  <img src="http://dummyimage.com/250">
                  
                  <div>
                    <h4>Crowding Out</h4><p>
                    Many nutrition experts give their clients a list of foods to
                    avoid and foods to eat, which explains why so many people are
                    turned off by nutrition. My approach is much different – by
                    eating and drinking foods that are good for you, you will
                    naturally have less room and desire for unhealthy foods.
                    Simply put, you will “crowd out” the unhealthy food in your
                    diet. This takes a little practice to make happen, but I will
                    support you all the way.

                    <h4>Deconstructing Cravings</h4><p>
                    Cravings play a critical role in understanding what your body
                    needs and shouldn’t be ignored. When you learn how to
                    deconstruct your cravings and understand what they’re really
                    telling you, you will be able to reclaim a sense of balance and
                    harmony.
                    </p>

                  <div>
                    <h4>Food-Mood Connection</h4><p>
                    Scientific research and personal experience both demonstrate
                    that what we eat affects how we think, how we feel
                    emotionally, and how we act.  Each person's food-mood
                    sensitivity varies, but once the correlation enters our
                    consciousness we are able – and feel compelled – to be more
                    careful with our food choices.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <img src="http://dummyimage.com/250">
                  
                  <div>
                    <h4>Balanced Attitude Toward Food</h4><p>
                    It's important to eat healthy foods to maintain good health,
                    but it can be unhealthy to be fanatical about food. It's not
                    what you eat some of the time but what you eat most of the
                    time that makes a difference. I will work with you to
                    understand that a balanced attitude about food is part of good
                    health.

                    </p>
                  </div>
                  </li>

                  <div>
                    <h4>Energy of Food</h4><p>
                    Food has distinct qualities and energetic properties,
                    depending on where, when, and how it grows, as well as how it
                    is prepared.  When we eat, we assimilate not only the
                    nutrients but also the food’s energy. I will help you increase
                    your awareness of, and connection to, your food. Tuning into
                    these subtle things makes us more conscious of how food
                    affects us.
                    </p>
